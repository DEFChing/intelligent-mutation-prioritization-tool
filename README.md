# IMPT - Intelligent Mutation Prioritization Tool

Cost-Effective Mutation Testing Utilizing Intelligent Mutation Operator Prioritization and Selection

## Overview

IMPT is a research project that reduces mutation testing time by 75-85% while maintaining ≥0.95 correlation with exhaustive testing through intelligent prioritization.

## Features

- ✅ Multi-Factor Scoring (5 factors: historical, complexity, security, recency, bugs)
- ✅ Subsumption Analysis (40-60% mutant reduction)
- ✅ Time-Budget Optimization (Knapsack algorithm)
- 🚧 Dynamic Adaptation (in progress)
- 🚧 Dual-Platform Support: PIT (Java) + Stryker (JavaScript)
- 🚧 Web Dashboard + CLI Interface

## Status

**Current Completion: 30%** (as of February 2026)

- [x] Multi-Factor Scoring Engine
- [x] Subsumption Analysis Module
